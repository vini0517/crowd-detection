üì¶ SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR CROWD DETECTION PROJECT

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open Anaconda Prompt or Terminal

2Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the project directory:

    cd path\to\your\project\folder

Example (Windows):

    cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\PROJECT\crowd_detection

3Ô∏è‚É£ Activate your Conda environment (make sure 'crowddetect' already exists):

    conda activate crowddetect

4Ô∏è‚É£ Install required Python libraries:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Flask web application:

    python app.py

6Ô∏è‚É£ Open your web browser and go to:

    http://127.0.0.1:5000/

üí° Optional:
- Place images to test inside the `uploads/` folder or upload from the web UI.
- Output images will be saved in the `static/` folder (like processed, density, and depth images).
- Make sure `crowddetection.pt` and `model.py` are in the project root for detection to work.

üõ† Tip:
If you haven't created the Conda environment yet:

    conda create -n crowddetect python=3.10
    conda activate crowddetect
